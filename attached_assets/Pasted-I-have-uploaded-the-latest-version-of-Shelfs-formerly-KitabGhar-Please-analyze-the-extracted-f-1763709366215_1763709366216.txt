I have uploaded the latest version of "Shelfs" (formerly KitabGhar).
Please analyze the extracted files (`main.py`, `models.py`, `templates/`, `static/`).

**Current Project State (Version 5.0 - Ultimate Build):**

1. **Identity & Theme:**
   - **Name:** "Shelfs" (Modern Digital Bookstore).
   - **Theme:** "Warm Library" (Paper White `bg-slate-50`, Amber Buttons `bg-amber-600`, Dark Slate text).
   - **Assets:** Professional Unsplash images for Hero, Auth, and About pages.

2. **New Visual Structure:**
   - **Footer:** Professional 4-column dark footer (Brand, Links, Categories, Contact).
   - **Search:** Hero section includes an **Advanced Search Bar** with a `<datalist>` that allows users to **Type OR Choose** a category.
   - **About Us:** Dedicated page with "Our Story" and Stats Grid.

3. **Critical Logic Fixes:**
   - **Checkout Bug (PRG):** Implements Post-Redirect-Get pattern (Redirects to `/order_success` with `no-cache` headers) so the **Back Button** does not re-submit orders.
   - **Cart Quantity:** Supports buying multiple copies. `/add_to_cart` increments quantity instead of ignoring duplicates. Cart UI shows `[-] Qty [+]` controls.
   - **Re-Purchase:** Cart is cleared immediately after purchase so users can buy the same book again instantly.

4. **Storefront Features:**
   - **Guest Logic:** Guests CANNOT see "Add to Cart". Clicking "View Now" redirects to Login.
   - **UI:** Star ratings removed from home cards.
   - **Tags:** Displays "Pill Badges" (e.g., Best Seller).

5. **Admin Dashboard (Advanced):**
   - **Hybrid Inventory:**
     - High Stock (>5): Auto-Approve, Stock -1, Instant Read.
     - Low Stock (<=5): Status 'Pending'. User sees "Awaiting Admin Confirmation".
     - Out of Stock (0): Purchase blocked.
   - **Analytics:** Chart.js Graph with **Date Range Filters** and **Grouping** (Daily/Monthly).
   - **Management:** Order Actions (Approve/Decline), User Deletion, and Book "Brief Description" field.

**My Goal:** I want to continue working on this exact version. Please acknowledge that you understand the current architecture.
